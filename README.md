# Digital-Verification
Here I implement a multi-mode counter that can:
- Count upwards
- Count downwards
- Count with variable step
- Can be loaded with an initial value
- Can be reset

Then using the count of this counter, we simulate a game 
between two players (WINNER and LOSER) then display the 
winning player.
